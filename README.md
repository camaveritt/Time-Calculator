Python3 project that calculates the resulting time of day (including AM/PM) and number of days passed after a given duration has transpired.

Accepts a time string in 12-hour clock format ending in AM or PM (IE. `"12:34 PM"` and a duration string in HH:MM format as parameters.

Additionally, a third optional parameter can be provided with a day of the week.  This will return the day of the week after the duration has transpired, along with the other information.  This optional parameter is not case-sensitive.
